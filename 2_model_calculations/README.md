# Content:  2-state model problem

   - SET1 : one set of `\tau` parameters [1000, 3000, 5000.0]
   - SET2 : an extended ste of `\tau` parameters  [1.0, 10.0, 25.0, 100, 500, 1000, 3000, 5000.0]

   For each set, we have the `gen` folders. They are different by the length of the trajectory used
   to train the ANNs:

   - gen1 : 100 fs
   - gen2 : 500 fs
   - gen3 : 1000 fs
   - gen4 : 5000 fs
   - gen5 : 15000 fs

   For each `gen` folder, we have `training` folders. They are different by the ANN architecture used

   - training1:  arch = [5]  
   - training2:  arch = [10] 
   - training3:  arch = [5, 5]
   - training4:  arch = [10, 10]



# How to run the jobs

1. Create the filesystem:

   - create the `gen*` folders:

        mkdir gen1
        mkdir gen2
        mkdir gen3
        mkdir gen4
        mkdir gen5

   - copy the content from the `training_template` into each directory, e.g.:

        cp -r training_template/* gen1


2. Prepare the working files 

   - edit `submit.slm` template as needed 
   - edit `run_namd.py` as needed with `what=2`


3. Submit the ANN training, NA-MD calculations, and fit/plotting scripts for all cases via:

        sh run_all.sh

4. Clean up: delete the unneeded files and directories `__pycache__` and `namd.out` but save the figures
   by running the `clean.sh` script

        sh ./clean.sh

   WARNINIG: This will also remove the data generated by the NAMD calculations so be sure you have
   good figures first.

   The data are MASSIVE but are FAST-to-GENERATE so it doesn't make sense to store it.
