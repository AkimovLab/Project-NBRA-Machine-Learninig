
*  **1_simple_example**: demonstrates how to run small-scale direct and ANN-based NA-MD calculations for a model Hamiltonian

*  **2_model_calculations**: scripts and data for the model calculations, the Hamiltonian used here is the same as in the
   example in `1_simple_example` folder

*  **3_mlbp_calculations**: scripts and data for the atomistic calculations, with the data for the divacancy-containing
   monolayer black phosphorus (ML-BP), computed at the TD-DFT/PBE level, as guided [here](https://github.com/AkimovLab/Project_ML-BP).
   This directory contains examples for 2-state and 5-state calculations
